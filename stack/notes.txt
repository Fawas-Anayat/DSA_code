"Stack"
It works on the principle that last in first out

Key Operations
Stacks support a limited set of operations:
-Push(x) → Add element x to the top of the stack.
-Pop() → Remove and return the element at the top.
-Peek() / Top() → View the element at the top without removing it.
-isEmpty() → Check if the stack is empty.
-isFull() (in case of fixed-size implementation, like arrays) → Check if the stack is full.
