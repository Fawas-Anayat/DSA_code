This is the course offered to us in our college.  
It means the data structures that actually stores our data and the algorithms though which we can perform diffrerent actions on that data.

### Data Structures
In C++ we have following some important data structures:

2.Vectors  
3.Linked List  
4.Graphs  
5.Trees

### Memory
Following are some of the concepts related to the memory that are needed to be understood:
